## Role Model Analysis & Interviews

To refine my career path, I have analyzed **two role model profiles**. These analyses help me project myself into specific job roles and understand the skills required in the industry.

### 1. Interview: Power Electronics Designer
**Contact:** Tony Fourmont, Safran Electronics & Defense <br>
**Source:** MyJobGlasses

> **Synthesis of the exchange:**
> *Technical skills are not enough. Curiosity and rigor are just as essential. In our field, you can’t just guess things; you need to know exactly why you are doing something and what results to expect, especially when safety is involved. Power electronics isn't complicated, but the laws of physics must be respected (Ohm’s law, thermal...).*
>
> **Key Takeaway:**
> *Always search your mind and constantly ask yourself questions !*
