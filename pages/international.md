## 1. Industrial Excellence: Safran Electrical & Power

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      <strong>Safran</strong> is a global tier-1 supplier of systems and equipment for aerospace and defense. For a specialization in Power Electronics, the target division is <strong>Safran Electrical & Power</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have strategic sites worldwide dedicated to the "More Electric Aircraft" initiative, focusing on high-voltage DC distribution, electric propulsion, and power management:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pitstone, UK:</strong> The center of excellence for power generation systems (generators/alternators).</li>
      <li><strong>Twinsburg & Sarasota, USA:</strong> Focused on power distribution, switchgear, and ram air turbine systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Chihuahua, Mexico:</strong> A major manufacturing hub for electrical wiring interconnection systems (EWIS) and components.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An internship here offers exposure to safety-critical avionics standards and high-density power conversion challenges.

## 2. Academic Research: Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; align-items: center; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      Located in Spain, the <strong>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)</strong> is a premier destination found in the mobility catalog (Erasmus Code: <em>ETSINF-054/061</em> or <em>ETSIME</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why this choice?</strong><br>
      UPM is home to the <strong>Centro de Electrónica Industrial (CEI)</strong>. This research group is internationally recognized for its work in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Resonant converters and high-frequency power conversion.</li>
      <li>FPGA-based control for power electronics.</li>
      <li>Smart grids and renewable energy integration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A semester here allows students to work alongside researchers publishing in top IEEE journals, combining theoretical depth with advanced laboratory prototyping.

## 3. Engineering Prestige: Technische Universität München (TUM)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 30px; margin-bottom: 40px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      Found in the German mobility list (Code: <em>Erasmus TU Munich-713 Electricity and energy</em>), <strong>TUM</strong> stands as one of Europe's top technical universities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why this choice?</strong><br>
      Located in Munich, the heart of the European automotive industry, TUM offers an unparalleled environment for <strong>Automotive Power Electronics</strong>. Their curriculum and research labs (such as the Chair of Electrical Drive Systems and Power Electronics) focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wide Bandgap Semiconductors (SiC and GaN application).</li>
      <li>Traction inverters for Electric Vehicles (EVs).</li>
      <li>Battery management systems (BMS).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Studying at TUM provides a rigorous theoretical framework and direct proximity to industry giants like BMW and Siemens.
