## 1. Industrial Excellence: Safran Electrical & Power

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 40px; margin-bottom: 60px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      <strong>Safran</strong> is a global tier-1 supplier of systems and equipment for aerospace and defense. The <strong>Electrical & Power</strong> division is at the heart of the "More Electric Aircraft" strategy, replacing pneumatic and hydraulic systems with electrical ones to reduce weight and emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Targeting their international sites offers a unique opportunity to work on the entire energy chain on board:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pitstone, UK:</strong> The global <em>Center of Excellence</em> for power generation. This site specializes in variable frequency generators and alternators crucial for modern airliners (A320neo, B787).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Twinsburg & Sarasota, USA:</strong> These sites focus on the primary and secondary power distribution systems, including the "brains" of the electrical network and critical safety backup systems like the Ram Air Turbine.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chihuahua, Mexico:</strong> A strategic industrial hub responsible for the manufacturing and design of complex Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS), ensuring signal integrity across the aircraft.
      </li>
    </ul>

## 2. Academic Research: Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row-reverse; align-items: center; gap: 40px; margin-bottom: 60px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      Located in Spain, the <strong>Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM)</strong> is a premier destination found in the mobility catalog (Erasmus Code: <em>ETSINF-054/061</em>). It is particularly renowned for hosting the <strong>Centro de Electrónica Industrial (CEI)</strong>, a research group with a massive impact on the IEEE community.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Areas of Specialization:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>High-Frequency Power Conversion:</strong> Advanced research into resonant converters and GaN (Gallium Nitride) devices to minimize the size of power supplies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Digital Control:</strong> Implementation of complex control algorithms using FPGA and DSPs for real-time power management.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smart Grids:</strong> Developing solid-state transformers (SST) and interfaces for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A semester at UPM offers a perfect balance between theoretical rigor and laboratory prototyping.

## 3. Engineering Prestige: Technische Universität München (TUM)

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center; gap: 40px; margin-bottom: 60px;">
  <div style="flex: 2;">
    <p>
      The <strong>Technische Universität München (TUM)</strong> appears in the German mobility list (Code: <em>Erasmus TU Munich-713</em>). Consistently ranked among the best technical universities in Europe, TUM benefits from its proximity to the Bavarian automotive giants (BMW, Audi).
    </p>
    <p><strong>Why TUM for Power Electronics?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Automotive Electrification:</strong> The curriculum is heavily oriented towards traction inverters and electric drivetrains for the next generation of Electric Vehicles (EVs).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wide Bandgap Semiconductors:</strong> Leading research on Silicon Carbide (SiC) applications to increase efficiency in high-power converters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Battery Systems:</strong> Advanced courses on Battery Management Systems (BMS) and energy storage technologies, critical for both mobility and stationary applications.
      </li>
    </ul>
