## The Importance of CSR in Power Electronics & Aviation

In the high-stakes world of **Power Electronics** and **Aeronautics**, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not just a concept—it is a technical imperative. As engineers, we must recognize that we "often make decisions that affect people's lives". We are the architects of the transition towards the *More Electric Aircraft*, a shift driven by the critical need for **environmental stewardship** to drastically reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation.

However, true responsibility extends beyond simply optimizing converters or reducing weight. It requires a holistic view of our impact. When designing high-power traction inverters or battery management systems, we must face ethical questions regarding the sourcing of raw materials (like rare earth metals) and the lifecycle of our components.

For me, engineering with impact means ensuring that our pursuit of performance—using technologies like Silicon Carbide (SiC) or Gallium Nitride (GaN)—does not create new problems elsewhere. It is about applying ethical frameworks to ensure that the electrification of the sky supports the sustainability of the planet.

    <p>
      The specific details of my civic engagement actions and volunteer projects are currently being documented. As indicated in the portfolio checklist, this section is under construction. It will soon be updated to showcase my direct contributions to the community and how I apply soft skills in a non-technical context.
